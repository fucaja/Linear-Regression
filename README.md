The variables used were: 
  # GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
  # SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars. This is the target variable that you're trying to predict.
The code was created in two parts, the first part is LR without libraries and the second part uses sklearn.

The code is based on the course created by gonzalez gouveia. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7gOUbSmGIY&list=PLbDLkhJ5sFvBJC6XnRSHMltAdKXI7Drw9&index=18
